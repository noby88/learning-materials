# GIT

## What is it?

- **Git** is a distributed **version-control system** for tracking changes in source code during software development. It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in **any set of files**. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.

- **Git** was created by **Linus Torvalds** in 2005 for development of the Linux kernel, with other kernel developers contributing to its initial development. Its current maintainer since 2005 is **Junio Hamano**. As with most other distributed version-control systems, and unlike most clientâ€“server systems, **every Git directory** on **every computer** is a **full-fledged repository** with complete history and full version-tracking abilities, independent of network access or a central server. Git is free and open-source software distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2.
