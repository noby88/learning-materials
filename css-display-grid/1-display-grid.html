    <h1>display: grid; - What is it?</h1>
    <section>
      <p>
        <strong>CSS Grid Layout</strong> (aka “Grid”), is a two-dimensional grid-based layout system that aims to do
        nothing less than completely change the way we design grid-based user interfaces. CSS has always been used to
        lay out our web pages, but it’s never done a very good job of it. First, we used tables, then floats,
        positioning and inline-block, but all of these methods were essentially hacks and left out a lot of important
        functionality (vertical centering, for instance). Flexbox helped out, but it’s intended for simpler
        one-dimensional layouts, not complex two-dimensional ones (Flexbox and Grid actually work very well together).
        Grid is the very first CSS module created specifically to solve the layout problems we’ve all been hacking our
        way around for as long as we’ve been making websites.

      <p>
        You work with Grid Layout by applying CSS rules both to a parent element (which becomes the
        <strong>Grid Container</strong>) and to that element’s children (which become <strong>Grid Items</strong>).

      <h1>Browser support</h1>
      <p>As of 2017 all better known browsers have support for CSS Grid in both mobile and desktop versions.</p>
      <p>The first ever browser to implement CSS Grid was released in 2012 September 04. (Guess which was it?)</p>
